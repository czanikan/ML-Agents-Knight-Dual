# ML-Agents Knight Duel
 
 Knight Duel is a tiny machine learning zero-player game based on the Unity ML-Agents framework. This is a hobby projekt for learning about RL and Deep Learning.
 
## How it works?
 
 Both knights are RL agents. They only know how to move in 4 direction and they are able to rotate. They can hold different weapons and the weapons rotate with the character. The main goal of the game to defeat the other knight agent by hitting it with the weapon a few time. They also have a tiny shield for self-defense. If one of them hit the enemy then gets reward. If defeat the enemy then also gets reward. Reinforcement learning agents learn from the rewards.
 
## Learning

 In the first version both agents have the same weapons and stats. After 30 minutes of learning they are learn to fight with each other, put they only use the same technic and not really take advantage of the shield potential.

I'm a computer science student at the University of Debrecen, Hungary.
My passion is game development and I mostly use the Unity game engine but I have experience with the Unreal Engine and Godot as well.

Most of the time I'm make stylized 3D games with low-poly graphic.
I'm also interested in Machine Learning and 3D modeling.
